## 🔍 Why Perplexity Might Not Show Your Site Yet

Perplexity doesn't have direct submission - it relies on:
1. **Being indexed by Google/Bing first** (primary source)
2. **Having backlinks** from other indexed sites
3. **Fresh, quality content** that answers questions
4. **Social signals** (mentions on social media)

**Action:** Submit to Google Search Console FIRST. Perplexity will follow within days.

## 📞 Need Help?

If your site still doesn't appear in search after 2 weeks:
1. Check Google Search Console for indexing errors
2. Verify robots.txt is accessible
3. Check for manual actions or penalties
4. Ensure site is actually live and accessible

**Remember:** SEO is a marathon, not a sprint. The optimizations are in place, but discovery and ranking take time. The most important next step is submitting your sitemap to Google Search Console!
